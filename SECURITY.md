## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

In your report, please include:

*   A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The potential impact of the vulnerability.
*   Any proof-of-concept code or exploits.

## Our Security Practices

We strive to follow best practices for security in our development process, including:

*   Regularly updating dependencies to their latest secure versions.
*   Using static analysis tools to identify potential security flaws.
*   Following secure coding guidelines.

## Disclosure Policy

Once a security vulnerability is reported, we will:

1.  Confirm the vulnerability and its impact.
2.  Develop a fix for the vulnerability.
3.  Release a new version of the project with the fix.
4.  Publicly disclose the vulnerability and credit the reporter (if they wish to be credited) after the fix has been released and users have had a reasonable amount of time to update.
